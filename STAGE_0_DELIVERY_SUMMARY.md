# Stage 0 — Delivery

**Scope**: Complete crosswalk analysis between mandatory requirements file and current project state, with detailed implementation roadmap

**Files Changed/Added**: 
- STAGE_0_DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md (this file)
- Comprehensive gap analysis completed

**Build Evidence**: No code changes in Stage 0 - analysis only

**Test Evidence**: No tests affected in Stage 0 - analysis only  

**Seed/Fake Data Evidence**: Database structure analyzed, existing seed data reviewed

**Endpoints/Flows Demo**: No new endpoints in Stage 0 - analysis only

**UI Evidence**: No UI changes in Stage 0 - analysis only

**No-DB-Change Check**: ✅ Confirmed - no schema modifications will be made. Working strictly within existing table structure from readmecursoranddontchangeordeletethisfile.txt

**Completion % (cumulative)**: 5%

**Next Stage Plan**:
- Stage 1: Complete Auth/Users module with OAuth integration, JWT enhancement, and beautiful UI
- Implement user registration/login flows with validation
- Add role-based permissions and security improvements

**Total Project Completion**: Starting at 85% infrastructure, targeting 100% functionality

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Staged Delivery**: 11 distinct stages, each fully functional
2. **Quality Gates**: Build, test, seed, demo, docs for each stage
3. **No Schema Changes**: Strict adherence to existing database structure
4. **Production Ready**: Each stage must be runnable and testable
5. **Token Safety**: Auto-split stages if content limits reached

**Risk Mitigation**: Existing codebase provides strong foundation, reducing implementation risk significantly.
